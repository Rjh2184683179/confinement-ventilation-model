This project develops a multi-zone series negative-pressure ventilation model applicable to nuclear facilities, isotope laboratories, and radiation-handling buildings. The model is used to analyze how pollutant concentrations evolve across zones, how contaminants are transported between regions, and how quickly the system reaches equilibrium under different zoning strategies. Based on mass conservation principles, the building is divided into multiple zones with distinct emission intensities and volume characteristics. The model explicitly considers the effects of primary exhaust flow, inter-zone airflow, external infiltration (leakage), and local exhaust differences on pollutant distribution.

Model Capabilities

Automatic zone classification based on pollutant emission intensity thresholds

Flexible treatment of corridors/buffer rooms as independent nodes or merged zones

Automatic extraction of key performance metrics including steady-state concentrations and 90% equilibrium time (T_eq)

Visualization of the final equilibrium-reaching zone (highlighted using a yellow pentagram marker)

Comparative analysis between the Nested Negative-Pressure and a Micro Positive-Pressure at annex room
